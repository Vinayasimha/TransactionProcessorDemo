Problem Description:
---------------------

Your team has been asked by the Finance department to create a program to process customer
transactions. Transaction data is received by file and needs to be processed and applied to customer loan
accounts.

During an analysis meeting with business stakeholders the following information is gathered:
-> Customer transactions files are received twice daily:
	-> once at 06:00 hours
	-> once at 21:00 hours
-> The file is in csv format and is formatted as follows:
	"Customer Account#", "Transaction Amount"
	123456789, 100.00
	987654321, -50.00
-> Each line in the file represents a customer transaction
-> Negative transaction amounts represent a debit against a customer account, and the customer’s account balance is increased
-> Positive transaction amounts represent a credit against a customer account, and the customer’s account balance is decreased.
-> Customer accounts numbers contain numerical characters only, however:
	-> some lines are encountered where the account number contains non numerical characters these lines are considered corrupt
	-> corrupt lines should not be processed but skipped
-> Files are received in a directory located at $TRANSACTION_PROCESSING/pending, where
	-> $TRANSACTION_PROCESSING is an environment variable referencing an arbitrary directory on each machine where the program will execute
	-> Filenames are in the format finance_customer_transactions-${datetime}.csv, where ${datetime} represents the time the file was written to the filesystem

-> When a file is received, processing of the file should commence within 5 minutes
-> Each file can contain up to 500,000 customer payments
-> Files must only be processed once
-> Processed files should be placed in $TRANSACTION_PROCESSING/processed
-> The same customer account number can appear multiple times in a customer payment file
-> Initially the Finance stakeholders would like to see the program process each file and produce a text report detailing:
	-> name of the file processed
	-> the number of accounts processed
	-> total credit amount
	-> total debit amount
	-> number of skipped lines

-> An example of the required report format was provided:

File Processed: finance_customer_transactions-20171201060101.csv
Total Accounts: 203,102
Total Credits : $856,480.70
Total Debits : $100,132.50
Skipped Transactions: 103

-> The report should be written to the directory $TRANSACTION_PROCESSING/reports
-> The report file name should be in the format finance_customer_transactions_report-${datetime}.txt
